### Key DAX Measures
 
Here are some of the central DAX measures used to drive the report's calculations:
 
* **Total Revenue:** Calculates the sum of all sales transactions.
    ```dax
    Total Revenue = SUMX('Sales', 'Sales'[Order Quantity] * 'Sales'[Unit Price])
    ```
* **YoY Revenue Growth %:** Calculates the year-over-year growth percentage for revenue.
    ```dax
    YoY Revenue Growth % =
    VAR CurrentYearRevenue = [Total Revenue]
    VAR PreviousYearRevenue = CALCULATE([Total Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('DimDate'[Date]))
    RETURN
    DIVIDE(CurrentYearRevenue - PreviousYearRevenue, PreviousYearRevenue)
    ```
* **Total Profit Margin:** Calculates the overall profit margin as a percentage.
    ```dax
    Total Profit Margin =
    VAR TotalProfit = SUMX('Sales', 'Sales'[Order Quantity] * ('Sales'[Unit Price] - 'Sales'[Unit Cost]))
    VAR TotalRevenue = [Total Revenue]
    RETURN
    DIVIDE(TotalProfit, TotalRevenue)
    ```
